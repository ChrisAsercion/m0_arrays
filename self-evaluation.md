1. How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
    -I feel semi-confident more or less. On my internet research for some arrays, I learned how to do different things with the method than what was asked for in the challenge so relearning a method was difficult.
2. Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
    -I think a review of the root functions of the methods would be good, so that I have a firm understanding of the needed syntax and use.
3. What questions do you have about Arrays?
    -I wonder all the different types of things you can do when grouping things together, so i'm curious as to what comes next.
